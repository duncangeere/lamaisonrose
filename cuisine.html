		<font face="Arial">The regional <b>cuisine </b>features local trout and game, sauces from morel and other mushrooms, and smoked and cured mountain hams and sausages (made from a range of meats). It is complemented by a range of distinctive cheeses, washed down with our fine wines, and digested with a local liqueur. </font>

		<font face="Arial">As a starter we could choose a salad with local smoked ham or sausage, or with diced local cheese and walnuts. But let's go for a <i>Croute aux Morilles</i>, a 'millefeuilles' stuffed with a rather rich sauce of strong-tasting morel mushrooms. The <i>morilles</i> (morels) are relatively difficult to find. Likely spots tend to be closely guarded family secrets. </font>

In season we might have game, whether venison, boar, partridge, pigeon, quail etc in which our surrounding forests abound. Fondues and raclettes of local cheeses are on the menu the year round, but particularly welcome after a day spent in the fresh air in winter.

	<p lang="en-GB" align="CENTER">
		<font face="Arial">The <b>Comté</b> is the most widely known. It is related to Gruyère. Fruity, salty or gritty in its varieties, and with holes if older, it is a firm cheese made in 35kg wheels and exported world-wide. It can be bought young or matured up to 18 months. You can visit <i>fromageries</i> or <i>fruitières</i> (cheese dairies) all over the area. The most convenient is, of course, the <i>fromagerie</i> in our village where, from the viewing platform, if you can get up reasonably early enough (08h00 to 10h00!), you can witness the production of Comté and Morbier cheeses. </font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="CENTER">
		<font face="Arial">And about 40 minutes' drive away you can visit an old fortress whose internal climatic conditions are conducive to the commercial storage and maturing of 65,000 wheels of cheese. An awesome sight! </font>

		<font face="Arial">The mild-tasting semi-firm <i><b>Morbier</b></i> cheese comes in a thick disk up to 8 kilos in weight. A distinctive black streak (of harmless soot!) runs horizontally through the middle of each cheese. This comes from the fact that it is traditionally produced in two halves which are then placed together. It is a winter/spring cheese, but is available throughout the year.</font>

		<font face="Arial">The <i><b>Mont d’Or</b></i> is a soft creamy cheese, produced from autumn to spring, which comes in a small-ish circular wooden box. We like to dig out a spoonful of the cheese, fill the hole with local white wine, bake it in the oven and then either pour it over jacket potatoes or, with pieces of bread, enjoy a mini-fondue. </font>

D'Or</a></p>
	<p lang="en-GB">&nbsp;</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">Mont d'Or cheese is of ancient origin, but was first mentioned in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. It is named after the highest point in the Haut-Doubs and is produced from 15<sup>th</sup> August to 15<sup>th</sup> March above 700m, but found in the shops from 10<sup>th</sup> September to 10<sup>th</sup> May. When cattle were not producing enough milk to make much Comte, Mont d'Or was made instead with milk exclusively from Montbeliard cows. Seven litres of milk is required to produce one kilo of Mont d'Or. Its woody flavors and tang come from the resinous box. It requires a minimum of 21 days to mature. The Mont d'Or has had its own appellation since 1981.</font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB"><br><br>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">Unique amongst cheeses is
			<i><b>Cancoillotte</b></i><b>,</b> a fruity-tasting, glutinous white cheese, which comes, natural or flavoured with garlic or white wine, in little pots and is spread, warm, on bread, toast or, as we have seen, on local sausage when served hot.</font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">The <i><b>Bleu de Gex</b></i> is a delicious mild, slightly bitter blue summer/autumn cheese from the hills above Geneva. It comes in a disk weighing up to 6 kg and complements nicely our local cheese board.</font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">There are several goat cheeses of which the most notable is perhaps the nutty-flavoured <i><b>Tomme de
Belley</b></i><b> </b>from the southern extremity of the region<b>.</b></font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">My personal Jura favourite is a
			<i><b>Tête de Moine</b></i> (a cousin to our <i>Comté</i>). Not included above because it comes from the Swiss side of the border, it is not difficult to find in French Hypermarkets or in nearby Switzerland. It is a firm, very fruity but spicy-tasting cheese that comes in the form of a circa 1 kilo drum. The Swiss spike it onto a contraption called a <i>Girolle</i> from which they shave it off in exquisite flowerets.</font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">Whilst talking of Switzerland, I might just say that <i><b>Gruyères</b></i>, the beautiful old village that is home to the famous cheese, is only about 2 hours’ drive from Nans.</font>

		<font face="Arial">Geographically, the nearest really good Jura wine centre under the '<i>Arbois'
Appellation,</i> is Montigny-les-Arsures, a pretty village, with horse-rides through the vineyards, 25 minutes in the car from Nans. Five minutes’ drive further on is Arbois itself and Pupillin where excellent wines are very convenient to access and to sample. Alas, <i>Nans</i> is just a few miles outside the wine producing region and, alas, the only vine that I have grows up my neighbour’s front wall!. </font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">Produced since time immemorial and mentioned by Pliny the Younger in the first century AD, the wines of the Jura were enjoyed for centuries by the Dukes of Burgundy and were relished particularly by the French kings Charles V and Francis I. They were also the subject of Louis Pasteur’s early research into the process of alcohol fermentation leading to today's system of pasteurisation. In 1936 they were the first in all of France to be officially recognised with an Appellation d'Origine Controlée (AOC). The limestone clay soil on which they are produced gives them a distinctive flavour - an acquired taste for some.</font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">&nbsp;</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">The <b>white</b> wines are produced from the <i>Chardonnay</i> and <i>Savagnin</i> grapes. They are dry, fruity and strong-bodied, the <i>Savagnin</i> being the stronger-tasting of the two, often matured in oak vats for 2 or 3 years. They keep very well and develop a nutty bouquet sometimes reminiscent of grilled almonds. Some of the best come from the village of <i>Pupillin</i> near <i>Arbois</i>. </font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">The most special of them is <b>yellow</b>
			<i>Vin Jaune</i>, a firm strong white wine from the <i>Savagnin</i> grape, kept casked for a minimum of 6 years to undergo a transformation similar to sherry, and best tasted after 50 years! Other specialities include the naturally sweet <i>Vins de Paille
(</i>said to have medicinal properties!<i>)</i>, the headier <i>Macvin
du Jura</i> (up to 22% proof), and a unique yellow <i>Eau de Vie</i> liqueur. </font>

	<p lang="en-GB" align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">The region is now becoming well-known for its fine and fruity <i>Crémants du Jura, </i>dry (and demi-sec), white and rosé sparkling wines of good quality, an elegant substitute for Champagne. At between £3.50 - £5 a bottle, you may want to take some back with you!</font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">The <b>grey</b> wine is simply very pale rosé, rather sharp and, served chilled, sometimes extremely appetising. The best <b>rosé</b>, from Arbois and Pupillin, by contrast, is perhaps more like pale red wine, unusually silky. </font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">The <b>red</b> comes from the Poulsard, Trousseau and Pinot Noir grape varieties. Perhaps less 'different' than the whites, and often blended, it can nevertheless be soft, smooth and enjoyable, particularly with the good local game.
		</font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">There is a museum at the Chateau Pécaud in Arbois which covers the history of the development of the superb local wines that we enjoy today. </font>

		<font face="Arial">But I give the last word on the subject to Louis Pasteur to whose house, laboratory and personal vineyard at Arbois I recommend a visit. He is quoted as saying that there is more philosophy in a glass of Jura wine than in all the books of philosophy in the world. So, if you want to get wise……!</font>

		<font face="Arial">Having studied all that, you now need to know that the village restaurant here is good for sampling some of these delights. But they are easily found throughout the area, as is more classical French cooking. Within 30 minutes' driving of Nans are two 4-star restaurants (<i>Chateau de Germigney</i>, at Port Lesney and <i>Jean-Paul Jeunet</i> at Arbois) and at least 6 3-star restaurants (<i>Chalet Bel'air</i>, <i>Relais du Pont d’Héry</i>,
			<i>Chateau d'Amondans</i>, <i>Le Moulin de la Mère Michelle</i>,
			<i>Caveau d'Arbois</i>, and <i>La Vallée Heureuse</i>). Furthermore, there are countless perfectly satisfactory possibilities in the 2-star category. For special occasions I go to the 3-star
			<i>Chalet Bel'air</i> at <i>Mouchard</i> 20 minutes away. Particular favourites of mine for every day are the <i>Auberge du Pont du Diable</i> 5 minutes away up in the next village of Crouzet Migette, the vaulted
			<i>Le P'tit Blanc</i> in Salins-les-Bains, and the chalet-style <i>La
Finette</i> in Arbois.</font>

	<p lang="en-GB">
		<font face="Arial">To complete the picture I should add that honey is produced in almost infinite variety as a cottage industry throughout the region. It is also made in Nans. Furthermore, until Brussels recently put a stop to it, we used to get butter from the village farm and fill our milk-jug there straight from the cow! Ah, those were the days!</font>
