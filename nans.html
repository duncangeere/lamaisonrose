	<p lang="en-GB" align="CENTER">
		<font face="Arial">The major local attraction is the spectacle (about 20 minutes’ walk from the cottage) of the <i>River Lison </i>cascading fully-formed from the side of the cliff in a deep wooded gorge. This is the second largest underground river in our Jura region, and you can enter the cavern from which it emerges to gain a ledge known as the <i>Chaire à
Prêcher</i> (the Pulpit) to observe the silently emerging river.

	<p lang="en-GB" align="CENTER">
		<font face="Arial">But the source of the
			<i>River Lison </i>is only the first of three spectacular geological phenomena in the gorge. Immediately behind and above the river’s official source is the <i>Creux Billard</i> (the Billiard Pocket), a deep chasm which provides a unique glimpse of the river’s erstwhile subterranean passage. Signs of Neolithic occupation have been found in a cave in its side. A cross upon a rock in the sump of the <i>Creux</i> commemorates a fatal fall in the 19C, but you won’t see it unless you are prepared to make a rather athletic descent into the pit to seek it out. After persistent heavy rain, a spectacular horse-tail cascade falls 80 metres from the lip of the pit in clouds of spray.</font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="CENTER">
		<font face="Arial">A few hundred yards’ walk away through the woods is the <i>Grotte Sarrazine</i> (the Monk’s Cowl Cavern) which, overhung by a precipitous wooded cliff, forms a gigantic natural porch almost 300 feet high and hosts falcons. Its usually dry cavern permits access with a torch, but after heavy rain the source, fed by a derivative of the <i>Lison</i>, flows copiously.</font>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="CENTER">
		<font face="Arial">These unusual sights all merit two stars in the Green Michelin guide and attract many visitors to the village, particularly on summer Sundays. </font>

	<p lang="en-GB" align="CENTER">
		<font face="Arial">But such caves and water sources are not uncommon in the region. Indeed, there are more around the village, including that which provides the stream that passes the end of my garden. This is the <i>Verneau</i> whose source is only a 10-minute walk away up in the cliffs behind the cottage. But what adventures the stream experiences in that short distance! Its waterfalls and other little cascades are particularly spectacular after rainfall and form a veritable adventure playground for children.

		<font face="Arial">Behind the cottage on the way up to the source of the <i>Verneau </i>is a tall square building that once served as a mill for the village. Amongst other things, pottery of a very high standard was produced there from 1833 until 1929. The mill has
			<img src="./nanssousstanne_files/Image25.jpg" name="graphics9" align="MIDDLE" width="185" height="204" border="0">been converted to residential use but what remains of the original interior is worth seeing if you can make a personal arrangement to do so. One of the principal features of the pottery of Nans was its pink rim. Although the quality of the product was good enough to serve even for Louis Pasteur's table, its high value in the antiques market today is attributable largely to its scarcity.</font>
